# Pewlett_Hackard_Challenge

## Background

  Pewlett-Hackard(PH) is a business firm that currently has 300,024 hired employees. The management at PH has informed us that many of their employees are reaching retirment age which will create many new job openings within the firm. PH wants to be prepared for this and make sure that the employees that are retiring can act as mentors to train the new generation of workers who would take the place at the firm.
  
## Overview of the Analysis

  The goal of the analysis is to gather data persisting to the employees that are reaching retirment age. PH has given us a date range of employees born between January 1st, 1952, to December 31, 1955. 
  
  The DB given by PH cinsists of 6 CSV files:
  -Employees 
  -Departments
  -Dat_emp
  -Titles
  -Salaries
